# Protodata

**Protodata** is a language for describing binary data,
originally written for prototyping binary file formats.
After Unix tradition, it’s designed to be lightweight and
composable, and interact well with other utilities.

# Building

```
git clone git@github.com:evincarofautumn/protodata.git
cd protodata
make
```

Protodata has been tested with G++ 4.6 on Linux.

# Examples

For the purposes of illustration, assume the following alias:

```
alias dump="hexdump -v -e '/1 \"%02X \"'"
```

View the hex representation of a floating-point number:

```
$ pd -e 'f64 1.0' | dump; echo
```

View the UTF-16 representation of some UTF-8 text:

```
$ pd -e 'utf16 "blah"' | dump; echo
```

Check out what a big-endian floating-point negative infinity
looks like up close:

```
$ pd -e 'big f64 -inf' | dump; echo
```

----

Suppose you have some raw vertex data in `input.raw`:

```
+1.0 +1.0 -1.0
+1.0 -1.0 -1.0
-1.0 -1.0 -1.0
-1.0 +1.0 -1.0
+1.0 +1.0 +1.0
-1.0 +1.0 +1.0
-1.0 -1.0 +1.0
+1.0 -1.0 +1.0
```

You want to pack these values as single-precision floats
into `output.bin` in such a way that you can `mmap()` the
output and index it as an array. If you didn’t have
Protodata, you might write a one-off C program like this:

```
cat <<EOF | gcc -x c - && ./a.out
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  FILE* in = fopen("input.raw", "r");
  FILE* out = fopen("output.bin", "w");
  float value;
  while (fscanf(in, " %f", &value) == 1)
    fwrite(&value, sizeof(value), 1, out);
  return 0;
}
EOF
```

To do the same thing with Protodata is straightforward:

```
$ pd -e 'f32' input.raw -o output.bin
```

Here, `f32` is a Protodata command, which sets the output
mode to 32-bit `float`. Now, both the C version and the
Protodata version use platform endianness. If we wanted to
change that to big-endian in the C version, we would have to
detect endianness and manually swap byte order. In
Protodata, however, we can simply use the `big` command:

```
$ pd -e 'big f32' input.raw -o output.bin
```

Like the C version, Protodata consumes input lazily and
produces output eagerly, making it suitable for streaming.

# Command-line Options

 * `FILE`

   Read and evaluate `FILE` as Protodata source.

 * `-e`, `--eval`

   Evaluate a string as Protodata source.

 * `-o`, `--output`

   Specify an output file; default is standard output.

Multiple `-e` and `FILE` options may be specified; they are
all concatenated in the order they appeared on the command
line, *before* being evaluated and *after* being parsed.
This means that any *individual* source file or `-e` string
is allowed to contain semantically invalid Protodata source,
as long as the concatenated source is semantically valid.

# The Language

*Features marked with a dagger (†) are subject to change.*

A Protodata source file consists of a series of *values*
and *commands*, delimited by whitespace and punctuated by
comments. Comments begin with `#` and continue to the end of
the line:

```
# A useless comment for demonstration purposes.
```

Source files must be encoded in UTF-8.

## Values

### Integer

#### Examples

```
 0      # Decimal, technically.
-12     # Decimal in the usual sense.
 020    # Still decimal.
+0b1010 # Binary.
-0o777  # Octal.
+0xFE   # Hexadecimal.
```

#### Regular Expression

```
[+-]?(0(b[01_]+|o[0-7_]+|x[0-9A-Fa-f_]+|[0-9_]*))
```

#### Notes

Integers with no sign character (`+` or `-`) are interpreted
as unsigned—go figure—and must fit within the range of
`uint64_t`; signed integers must fit within the range of
`int64_t`.

### Floating-point

#### Examples

```
 0.0
-0.0
 0.5
+0.5
 6.28318
 inf
-inf
 nan
 epsilon
```

#### Regular Expression

```
[+-]?([0-9][0-9_]*\.[0-9][0-9_]*|inf|nan|epsilon)
```

#### Notes

Floating-point values cannot be represented by `utf` or
integer types. Unlike for integers, sign characters have no
effect on floating-point representation, only sign bit.

### String

#### Examples

```
""
"salut"
```

#### Regular Expression

```
"([^"\\]|\\[\\"abefnrtv])*"
```

#### Notes

A string is syntactic sugar for a sequence of integer values
corresponding to Unicode code points. Strings are not
null-terminated; an empty string is a no-op. The following
common escapes are allowed:

 * `\\` ⇒ `\` = U+005C

 * `\"` ⇒ `"` = U+0022

 * `\a` ⇒ BEL = U+0007

 * `\b` ⇒ BS = U+0008

 * `\e` ⇒ ESC = U+001B

 * `\f` ⇒ FF = U+000C

 * `\n` ⇒ LF = U+000A

 * `\r` ⇒ CR = U+000D

 * `\t` ⇒ HT = U+0009

 * `\v` ⇒ VT = U+000B

## Commands

### Size and Encoding

 * <code>s<var>N</var></code>

   A signed integer with <code><var>N</var></code> bits,
   where 1 ≤ <code><var>N</var></code> ≤ 64.

 * <code>u<var>N</var></code>

   An unsigned integer with <code><var>N</var></code> bits,
   where 1 ≤ <code><var>N</var></code> ≤ 64.

 * `f32`, `f64`

   A single- or double-precision floating-point number.

 * `utf8`, `utf16`, `utf32`, `ucs2`

   A Unicode code point in the given transmission format.
   `utf32` is an alias for `u32`, and `ucs2` for `u16`.

   The following produces three copies of the same
   (two-byte) sequence:

        u8 0xC3 0xA7
        utf8 "ç"
        utf8 231

If output ends on a non-8-bit boundary, it will be padded
with trailing zero bits.

The default type is `unsigned int`, however wide `int`
happens to be on the current platform.†

### Endianness

 * `native`

 * `little`

 * `big`

The default endianness is `native`. The `s8`, `u8`, and
`utf8` types ignore the current endianness.

### Compiler State

 * `{`

   Save the compiler state.

 * `}`

   Restore the compiler state.

These commands are best explained by example. Here, `10`,
`20`, and `30` will be written as `u32`, while `1` through
`6` will all be written as `u8`:

```
u32
10 { u8 1 }
20 { u8 2 3 }
30 { u8 4 5 6 }
```

# Planned Features

## Templates and Binary Input

You may want to read a binary data file and perform some
structured query on it, or extract part of the file. This is
highly dependent on the format of the data in question.
Protodata templates will allow you to declaratively specify
a file format, then read and write data in that format.

## Expressions

```
( ... )
```

Evaluate an expression with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`
operators, as well as the following sorts of functions:

 * `align(N = 1, X = 0)`

   Align subsequent values on `N`-byte boundaries with
   `u8` padding value `X`.

 * `repeat(N = 1)`

   Repeat the next value `N` times.

 * `count(Name)`

   Write the number of elements in `Name`, where all of the
   elements must have the same type. Useful for Pascal-style
   strings:

        pascal(string) = { count(string) string() }

 * `size(Expr)`

   Write the size in bytes of `Expr`.
